I gonna simulate 4 scenarios:
1. optimal: assumes the server has unlimited resources
2. current: server has bounded resources and it does all the message delivery
3. p2p: (piece size is a trade off)server cut the follower set into different pieces and pick one user to do the msg delivery in each piece
4. Centuar: (redundancy trade off)

stats:
1. msg delivery delay: we need a timestamp append at each package
2. msg missing rate: keep a follower set for each msg, delete the follower set which is older than T time units
3. user load balancing: (a) msg * follower (b) network
4. server traffic (this should only applies to Centuar)
